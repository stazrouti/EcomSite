# EcomSite

This e-commerce site is built using PHP (MVC) and MySQL and includes an integrated administration panel. It offers two main parts: a user interface and an admin interface.

The user interface allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and make purchases. Products are categorized, making it easier for users to find what they're looking for. The site also includes user registration and login functionality, enabling users to sign up and store their information securely.

The admin interface is designed for website administrators. It grants them the ability to manage the entire product inventory. Administrators can add new products to the website, remove existing ones, and modify product details as needed. This feature allows for easy maintenance and updates to the website's offerings.
